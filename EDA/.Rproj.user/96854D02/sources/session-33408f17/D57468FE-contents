# Exploring our Social Media Survey Data
```{r}
data <- read.csv("../inputs/train.csv")
data <- data %>%
  drop_na() # Removing the blank lines in the data.
```

### Transforming our Categorical Data into Numerical Data
----------------
We will be using "One-Hot Encoding" for this transformation which separates categorical data into its own columns and gives a binary classification (yes or no) for each row.

**Mutating the Gender variable**:
```{r}
data <- data %>%
  mutate(dummy = 1) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Gender, values_from = dummy, values_fill = 0) # Fill spaces without the given gender category with 0.
```

**Mutating the Platform variable**:
```{r}
data <- data %>%
  mutate(dummy = 1) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Platform, values_from = dummy, values_fill = 0) # Fill spaces without the given gender category with 0.
```

**Mutating the Dominant_Emotion variable**:
```{r}
data <- data %>%
  mutate(dummy = 1) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Dominant_Emotion, values_from = dummy, values_fill = 0) # Fill spaces without the given gender category with 0.
```

### Performing Standardization of our Data
--------
```{r}
data_features <- data[, !names(data) %in% c("User_ID", "Happiness", "Anger", "Neutral", "Anxiety", "Boredom", "Sadness")] # Not going to standardize the target columns or User_ID

standardized_data <- as.data.frame(scale(data_features))

# This resulting DataFrame will have standardized data (with classifiers already being 0 or 1) and exclude the User ID, along with principle components that are not necessary, to remove irrelevant data that can mess with the Euclidean Distance weighting.
result <- cbind(standardized_data, data[, c("Happiness", "Anger", "Neutral", "Anxiety", "Boredom", "Sadness")])
```

### Export our cleaned and processed data
```{r}
write.csv(result, "cleaned_train.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```
